## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This project analyzes the sales performance of Maven Toys, a fictional chain of toy stores across Mexico. Using Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard to identify trends, profitability patterns, and strategic opportunities for business growth.

## Business Problem

Maven Toys experienced a sales decline from 2022 to 2023 and needed insights to:
- Reverse the declining sales trend
- Identify performance gaps across store locations  
- Optimize profitability strategies for high-margin stores
- Understand seasonal demand patterns

##  Key Metrics & Results

| Metric | Value | Impact |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Total Revenue** | $14.44M | Baseline performance analysis |
| **Total Profit** | $4.01M | 27.8% overall profit margin |
| **Units Sold** | 1M | Volume performance tracking |
| **Q2 Performance** | $5.62M (38.9%) | Identified peak season opportunity |
| **Profit Margin Range** | 28.6% - 33.1% | Geographic optimization potential |

##  Key Insights Discovered

### 1. Seasonal Performance Patterns
- **Q2 dominance:** 38.9% of annual sales concentrated in Q2
- **Q3 underperformance:** Significant drop to $2.03M
- **Opportunity:** Seasonal strategy optimization could boost annual performance

### 2. Geographic Performance Disparities
- Cities like **Morelia and Mexicali** showing strong profit margins
- Revenue varies dramatically ($273Kâ€“$1.65M per city)
- **Strategic insight:** High profitability doesn't correlate with high revenue

### 3. Store Location Analysis
- **Downtown locations** lead in revenue generation
- Profitability varies significantly by location type
- **Optimization opportunity:** Replicate successful strategies across locations

##  Technical Implementation

### Data Architecture
- **5 interconnected tables:** Products, Sales, Stores, Inventory, Calendar
- **Relationship modeling:** Proper star schema implementation
- **Data volume:** 1M+ transactions analyzed

##  Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (0-3 months)
1. **Leverage Q2 Success Factors**
   - Analyze product mix driving Q2 performance
   - Implement similar strategies for Q3/Q4

2. **Geographic Focus**
   - Prioritize high-margin, low-revenue cities
   - Targeted marketing investment

### Medium-term Strategy (3-12 months)
3. **Store Optimization**
   - Replicate successful store formats
   - Location-specific product mix optimization

4. **Inventory Alignment**
   - Match inventory with seasonal patterns
   - Improve turnover in underperforming locations

## Business Impact

**Expected ROI:** 15-20% profitability increase through:
- Optimized resource allocation
- Strategic geographic focus
- Seasonal strategy enhancement
- Store format replication
